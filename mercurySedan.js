//After you write the derived Car class, you should test it out.

//Note: You can code your derived Car class here or make a file named index.js and do it there.


//TO DO: Code the Car subclass here or in index.js file, i.e. class Car extends Vehicle ...


//TO DO: Creating Instances and Testing Them

//You can use the same instance "v" of the Vehicle class above for the base class.





//Create at least two new instances of the Car class and test them here:
